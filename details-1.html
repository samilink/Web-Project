            This position within the sorority was one of my favorite I have held so far. I was given the opportunity to be elected to this position, and be trusted with the set-up of the twin-XL sized banners. These projects took around 30 hours to create total, between painting, buying supplies, and utilizing different Adobe applications (Photoshop and Illustrator).

            I attempted to keep the color palette relatively neutral and related to University of Minnesota colors, since the 3 banners not included were much brighter.
