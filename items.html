                <h2>Banner Design</h2>
                 <p> I created this piece as a design for my sorority's work week banners. Out of 5 banners designed and painted total, this one exemplified the 'Game Day' theme, and pictures our school mascot swinging outside our house.The cresent in the background represents Gamma Phi's unifying symbol, a cresent moon.

            <h2>Movie Poster</h2>
            <p>This Midsommar poster was made during my Graphic Studio course at the University of Minnesota. It contains subtle themes of religion with the arch frame, and halo figure around Florence Pugh, relating to themes of the movie itself. Other details of the poster include a light and colorful theme, despite the movie's dark foundational meaning.

            <h2>Banner Design</h2>
            <p>This was another banner for the Gamma Phi Beta sorority. The theme this time was, 'Rounding Up the Best', so I sought out to create something unique from the typical cowboy hat design. The plants on the side refer to our sorority flower: the carnation.</p>

            <div>
            <p>This was another piece created for 'Color in 2D and 3D', and is meant to display a chroma bridge between two colors. The colors were intentionally place to create a gradient-like fashion.
